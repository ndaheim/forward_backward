# forward_backward

Implements the forward backward algorithm for lattices over different Semirings, as well as the calculation of edge and time frame word posteriors for Automatic Speech Recognition.

This project is a side project I am doing out of interest, inspired by the Advanced Methods in Automatic Speech Recognition course i took @ RWTH Aachen University, and will be extended by more functionality in the future.
